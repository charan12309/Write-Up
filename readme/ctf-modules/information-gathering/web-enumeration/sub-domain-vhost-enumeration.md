# Sub Domain/Vhost Enumeration

Subdomains extend the main domain and often expose separate applications or services.

Examples include `blog.example.com`, `shop.example.com`, and `mail.example.com`.

### Why subdomains matter

Subdomains often expose assets that are not linked from the main site.

Common examples:

* `Development and Staging Environments` — may run weaker controls or older code
* `Hidden Login Portals` — may expose admin panels or internal access points
* `Legacy Applications` — may still run outdated and vulnerable software
* `Sensitive Information` — may expose files, data, or configuration details

### Subdomain enumeration

`Subdomain enumeration` is the process of identifying and listing subdomains for a target domain.

From a DNS perspective, subdomains are usually represented by `A` or `AAAA` records. They may also use `CNAME` records to point to other hosts.

There are two main approaches.

#### Active subdomain enumeration

This approach interacts directly with the target's DNS infrastructure.

One method is a `DNS zone transfer`. A misconfigured server may expose the full zone. This is uncommon, but still worth testing when allowed.

Another common method is `brute-force enumeration`. This tests a list of possible names against the target domain. Tools such as `dnsenum`, `ffuf`, and `gobuster` automate this process with common or custom wordlists.

#### Passive subdomain enumeration

This approach uses external data sources and avoids direct interaction with the target's DNS servers.

Useful sources include:

* `Certificate Transparency (CT) logs` — certificates often list subdomains in the SAN field
* `Search engines` — operators such as `site:` can reveal indexed subdomains
* `Online DNS databases` — many services aggregate DNS data from multiple sources

Passive methods are quieter. Active methods are usually more complete. Combining both gives better coverage.

### Subdomain brute-forcing

`Subdomain brute-force enumeration` tests pre-defined names against the target domain to find valid subdomains.

This usually follows four steps:

1. `Wordlist selection`
   * `General-purpose` — common names such as `dev`, `staging`, `blog`, `mail`, `admin`, and `test`
   * `Targeted` — names based on the target's industry, stack, or naming patterns
   * `Custom` — names built from intelligence gathered during recon
2. `Iteration and querying`
   * Append each word to the root domain, such as `dev.example.com`
3. `DNS lookup`
   * Query each candidate and check whether it resolves
4. `Filtering and validation`
   * Keep valid results and confirm whether the host is live or useful

### DNSEnum

`dnsenum` is a command-line tool written in Perl for DNS reconnaissance and subdomain discovery.

Key functions include:

* `DNS Record Enumeration` — retrieves records such as `A`, `AAAA`, `NS`, `MX`, and `TXT`
* `Zone Transfer Attempts` — tests discovered name servers for `AXFR`
* `Subdomain Brute-Forcing` — tests candidate names from a wordlist
* `Google Scraping` — looks for subdomains indexed in search results
* `Reverse Lookup` — finds domains associated with an IP address
* `WHOIS Lookups` — gathers registration and ownership details

This example enumerates subdomains for `inlanefreight.com` with a SecLists wordlist:

```bash
dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -r
```

Command breakdown:

* `dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com` — sets the target domain and enables common enumeration options
* `-f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt` — uses the SecLists wordlist for brute force
* `-r` — enables recursive brute forcing against discovered subdomains

Example output:

```shell
impale7@htb[/htb]$ dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt

dnsenum VERSION:1.2.6

done.
```

### DNS zone transfers

Brute forcing works well, but `AXFR` is faster when it is exposed.

A DNS zone transfer replicates records between name servers. If it is misconfigured, you may get the full zone file in one request.

### What a zone transfer is

A zone transfer is a full copy of the records in a DNS zone.

Authoritative servers use it to keep primary and secondary servers in sync. If access controls are loose, an unauthorized client can pull the same data.

![Diagram showing data transfer between secondary and primary servers. Includes steps: XML Request, XML Record, loop for retries, XML Report, and AOK (Acknowledgment).](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/144/ig_dns_zone_transfers_1.png)

Typical flow:

1. **AXFR request** — the secondary server requests a full transfer.
2. **SOA record** — the primary server returns the zone authority details.
3. **Record transfer** — the server sends records such as `A`, `AAAA`, `MX`, `CNAME`, and `NS`.
4. **Transfer complete** — the server signals the end of the transfer.
5. **Acknowledgment** — the secondary server confirms receipt.

### Why misconfigured transfers matter

Zone transfers are normal for DNS operations. The risk comes from weak access controls.

If any client can request `AXFR`, the server may disclose the entire zone. That gives you a high-value map of the target infrastructure.

Useful data often includes:

* `Subdomains` — hidden apps, staging hosts, admin panels, and internal naming patterns
* `IP addresses` — direct targets for scanning and service validation
* `Name server records` — authoritative infrastructure and possible hosting clues

#### Remediation

Modern DNS servers should allow transfers only to trusted secondary servers.

Misconfigurations still happen. That is why testing `AXFR` remains worth a quick check when scope allows.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Attempt zone transfers only when you have authorization.
{% endhint %}

### Testing with `dig`

Use `dig` to request a zone transfer from an authoritative server:

```bash
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```

This requests a full zone transfer for `zonetransfer.me` from `nsztm1.digi.ninja`.

If the server allows it, `dig` returns the full set of DNS records, including subdomains.

Example output:

```shell
impale7@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me

Virtual Hosts

***

Once DNS sends traffic to the right IP, the web server decides what content to serve.

That decision often depends on `virtual hosts`, or `VHosts`.

### Why virtual hosts matter

One server can host many sites or apps.

The server uses the request details to decide which one to return.

This matters during recon because a target may expose:

* hidden apps
* admin panels
* staging sites
* internal-only names

### VHosts vs subdomains

These terms overlap, but they are not the same.

* `Subdomain` — a DNS name under a parent domain, such as `blog.example.com`
* `VHost` — a web server config that maps a hostname to content

Key point:

* a subdomain usually has a DNS record
* a VHost may exist even without public DNS

If a VHost has no DNS record, you can still test it by sending the right `Host` header or by adding it to your local `hosts` file.

{% hint style="info" %}
No DNS record does not mean no website.
{% endhint %}

### How virtual host routing works

At the core of virtual hosting is the `Host` header.

The browser sends it with every HTTP request. The web server reads it and picks the matching site config.

Typical flow:

1. You request `http://target`.
2. The request includes a `Host` header, such as `admin.example.com`.
3. The server checks its virtual host configuration.
4. If a match exists, it serves that site's document root.
5. If no match exists, it serves the default site or returns an error.

![Sequence diagram showing interactions between Browser, WebServer, VirtualHostConfig, and DocumentRoot. Includes HTTP request, server response, and file access steps.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/144/ig_virtualhosts_1.png)

### Example virtual host config

Different hostnames can point to different content on the same server.

```apache
# Example of name-based virtual host configuration in Apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example1
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example2.org
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example2
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.another-example.net
    DocumentRoot /var/www/another-example
</VirtualHost>
```

The server uses the `Host` header to decide which block applies.

### Types of virtual hosting

#### Name-based hosting

This is the most common model.

The server uses the `Host` header to distinguish sites on the same IP.

Why it matters:

* easy to deploy
* cost-effective
* common in real targets

#### IP-based hosting

Each site gets its own IP address.

The server chooses content based on the destination IP instead of the hostname.

Why it matters:

* stronger separation
* works without hostname matching
* less common due to IP usage

#### Port-based hosting

Each site listens on a different port.

Examples include `:80`, `:8080`, or `:8443`.

Why it matters:

* useful when hostnames are not enough
* less user-friendly
* easy to miss if you only check standard ports

### Why VHost fuzzing works

A target may host sites that:

* are not linked anywhere
* do not appear in public DNS
* resolve only inside the target network

You can still discover them by sending different `Host` headers to a known IP.

This is usually called `VHost fuzzing`.

### Fast VHost workflow

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Identify the target

Start with a live web server IP or a base domain that resolves.

You need a reachable target first.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Prepare candidate names

Use a wordlist with names such as:

* `dev`
* `admin`
* `staging`
* `test`
* `api`

Add custom names from recon when possible.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Fuzz the `Host` header

Send requests to the target IP with different hostnames.

Look for unique responses by:

* status code
* body length
* title
* redirect target
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Validate findings

Retest interesting hits manually.

Add them to your `hosts` file if you want to browse them directly.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### `gobuster` for VHosts

`gobuster` is one of the fastest ways to brute force virtual hosts.

Basic syntax:

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://<target_IP_address> -w <wordlist_file> --append-domain
```

Important flags:

* `-u` — target URL or IP
* `-w` — wordlist path
* `--append-domain` — appends the base domain to each candidate
* `-t` — thread count
* `-k` — ignore TLS certificate errors
* `-o` — save output to a file

In newer `gobuster` versions, `--append-domain` is required for this workflow.

Example:

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:81 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
```

Example output:

```shell
impale7@htb[/htb]$ gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:81 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain

### How to read the results

A hit is not always useful.

Focus on results that differ from the default response.

Good indicators:

* a different status code
* a different response size
* a unique page title
* a redirect to a named host

Retest promising results with:

```bash
curl -H "Host: forum.inlanefreight.htb" http://inlanefreight.htb:81
```

### Practical notes

`VHost` discovery can create a lot of traffic.

It may trigger `IDS`, `WAF`, or rate limits.
